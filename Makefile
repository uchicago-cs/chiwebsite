# For the deploy target to work, a worktree must be created
# in _build/html that tracks the gh-pages branch. You can do
# so by running this from the root of a freshly cloned version
# of the repo:
#
#   git worktree add -B gh-pages _build/html origin/gh-pages
#
# If you move the repo to a different directory, run this from
# the root of the repo to update the worktree's paths:
#
#   git worktree repair _build/html
#
# Since the site is rebuilt from scratch every time, the deploy target
# moves the gh-pages branch to the latest remote commit (keeping the
# freshly built files) before committing, so that deploying from a
# checkout whose gh-pages branch is out of date doesn't fail.
